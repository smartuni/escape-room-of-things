# Weight puzzle

This program measures the ouput of a load cell and converts it to a weight value. When the value is within the borders of a set goal for 2.5 seconds an LED will turn on, the puzzle is solved. The wanted value is 400g (water) + 22g weight of the bottle. When starting the puzzle the bottle cannot be on top of the weigh.
